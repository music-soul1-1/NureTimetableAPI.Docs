# Hi👋, welcome to NureTimetableAPI documentation!

> **NureTimetableAPI** is a project written to simplify the process of getting the schedule for students/teachers/auditories of the Kharkiv National University of Radio Electronics.
>
> The API uses the data from [cist.nure.ua](https://cist.nure.ua) JSON API and provides a convenient way to get the schedule in JSON format. With this API you don't have to worry about invalid JSON or request time limits.
>
> API is currently hosted for free on [MonsterASP.NET](https://www.monsterasp.net/)

😺 GitHub of the API is available [here](https://github.com/music-soul1-1/NureTimetableAPI).

🧑🏼‍💻 An **app** for Windows, Android, and Web is available [here](https://github.com/music-soul1-1/nure-timetable).
