# Hi👋, welcome to NureTimetableAPI documentation!

> **NureTimetableAPI** is a project designed to simplify the process of retrieving schedule for students, teachers, and auditories at the Kharkiv National University of Radio Electronics.
>
> The API utilizes data from the [cist.nure.ua](https://cist.nure.ua) JSON API and offers a convenient way to access the schedule in JSON format. The response models are comprehensive, providing all the data needed. With this API you don't have to worry about invalid JSON or request time limits.
>
> API is currently hosted for free on [MonsterASP.NET](https://www.monsterasp.net/)

😺 GitHub of the API is available [here](https://github.com/music-soul1-1/NureTimetableAPI).

🧑🏼‍💻 An **app** for Windows, Android, and Web is available [here](https://github.com/music-soul1-1/nure-timetable).
