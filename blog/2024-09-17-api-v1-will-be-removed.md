Hello everyone,

We would like to inform you that we will be removing version 1 of the API on 20.09.2024. Please make sure to update your applications accordingly.

So for now, there will only be version 2 of the API available.

P.S. We see a lot of downtime on CIST API now, that's why a lot of the time we run the Hangfire fetching jobs manually, when Cist is working.
