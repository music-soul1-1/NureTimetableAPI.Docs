This project was created as a pet-project to develop my skills with ASP .Net Core and Entity Framework. 
Because it's my first big project with these frameworks, it may contain some bugs and issues. 
They'll be fixed in the nearest future.

Also, there's "cist.nure.ua" side of things. Because Cist often brakes it's JSON responses (which are used to get data for this project),
the project stability is mostly dependent on Cist's.

Right now, you can report any issues in the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/music-soul1-1/NureTimetableAPI/issues/new).
Later, a Telegram/WhatsApp channel will be created for the project.

Lastly, please check out the 
[cross-platform app (Web too)](https://github.com/music-soul1-1/nure-timetable) and 
[.NET library](https://github.com/music-soul1-1/NureTimetableAPI.DotNetLib).

If you want to develop the project, or create a new one based on this API, you're free to do so.
